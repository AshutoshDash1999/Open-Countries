# Country Open Info

Hey ğŸ‘‹,
I made a Country Open Info view where you can search about the country with given parameters.
The website can search countries based on:
ğŸ‘‰Name (obviously)
ğŸ‘‰Country Code
ğŸ‘‰Currency
ğŸ‘‰Language
ğŸ‘‰Capital
ğŸ‘‰Region and Subregion

I made use of the Rest Countries API: https://restcountries.com/
